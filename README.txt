README

Details:
The application is a web-based application.

Running the application:
You can copy all of the related files to a server (e.g. tux) and host the application yourself (it cannot be run locally in its current state as it uses google fonts that are only available with internet access).
Alternatively, you can access a tux hosted version of the application on:
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~drs332/cs530/Project/projectHomepage

You can either create a new course from scratch or select the included "Calculus.json" file
If you wish to see a pre-exported course (the "Calculus.json" file), select it on the file browser, confirm the selection, and edit the confirmed course
This will take you to the course homepage.

Should you have any details running the application, I can be contacted at: drs332@drexel.edu
